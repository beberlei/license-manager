        <h3>Welcome to the License Switcher!</h3>

        <p>The world of open-source licensing is tricky. Open-source licenses
        are not always compatible to each other and picking the wrong license
        can harm the apdotion of your project depending on the ecosystem you
        are targeting.</p>

        <p>Changing the license of an open-source project after you already had
        some contributions requires some work. You need the consent of all
        committers.</p>

        <p>The Open-Source License Switcher project helps you change the
        license of your project by offering tools to ask all the contributors
        for their permission to change the license.</p>
